# 📅 Day 37 – Risk Check-Up: Identifying Threats & Vulnerabilities in OpenMRS  
_100 Days of GRC • By Ibrahim Abdullahi_

##  Diagnosing Risk Like a Pro

A few months ago, I sat in a small community clinic shadowing an IT technician. As a nurse struggled to log into OpenMRS, the admin casually shared passwords aloud over her shoulder. No MFA, no session timeout, and a default admin username still active.

It wasn’t malicious — it was a system grown out of necessity, not design.

That memory stayed with me.

Today, as part of our GRC journey, we stepped into one of the most critical responsibilities in cybersecurity leadership: **Risk Assessment** — the moment where we ask:  
**"What could go wrong?"**  
**"Where are we vulnerable?"**

---

##  Objectives for Today

- Define what a system risk assessment is  
- List threats that could harm OpenMRS (external, internal, accidental)  
- Identify vulnerabilities OpenMRS may have  
- Distinguish threats from vulnerabilities with clarity  
- Strengthen risk awareness in cloud-based healthcare systems

##  What Is a Risk Assessment?

Risk assessment is the **diagnostic exam** of cybersecurity. Like a doctor detecting early symptoms before they become life-threatening, GRC leaders identify threats (the causes of harm) and vulnerabilities (the weak spots where that harm can enter).  

 **Threat = the danger**  
 **Vulnerability = the opening**  
 **Risk = when those two meet**

##  Case Study: OpenMRS in AWS Cloud (MyClinic Scenario)

###  External Threats
- **Hackers** scanning internet-facing portals for SQL injection flaws  
- **Ransomware** attempting to encrypt patient databases  
- **Malware** infecting endpoints that access OpenMRS  

###  Internal Threats
- **Disgruntled staff** accessing records they shouldn’t  
- **Well-meaning staff** misconfiguring access controls  
- **Phishing victims** clicking malicious links  

###  Environmental/Natural Threats
- **Power outages** in local clinics (if using hybrid deployments)  
- **Cloud service disruptions**  
- **Data corruption** from system bugs or failed patches

##  Vulnerabilities in the System

-  **Unpatched OpenMRS version** – known exploits remain open  
-  **Misconfigured AWS S3 backups** – publicly accessible!  
-  **Default credentials** still active on admin accounts  
-  **Lack of encryption** for data at rest or in motion  
-  **No staff security training** – high social engineering risk  
-  **No regular backups or integrity checks**  
-  **Improper session management** – risk of session hijacking

##  My Leadership Approach

Today, I didn’t just brainstorm — I assumed the mindset of a **CISO diagnosing a live system**. I drafted a two-column matrix:

| Threats                         | Vulnerabilities                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| External hackers               | Unpatched OpenMRS codebase                 |
| Insider data misuse            | No role-based access control enforcement   |
| Power outage                   | No regional data replication               |
| Phishing campaign              | No staff awareness or reporting procedure  |
| Malware/ransomware             | No endpoint protection on clinic systems   |

Each pairing tells a story of **impact + opportunity**, and that’s where real risk lives.

##  Reflection

**The threat that keeps me up at night?** Insider misuse.

Why? Because insiders have context. They don’t need to “hack” their way in — they already have the keys. Whether out of curiosity, negligence, or intent, an insider accessing or leaking PHI can undermine years of security work in seconds.

##  GRC Wisdom of the Day

> **“You can’t patch human intent — but you can build controls that assume fallibility.”**

We lead best not when we trust blindly, but when we design systems that *respect the reality of error*.

---

##  What’s Next?

Tomorrow, we’ll take this list and analyze it. Not all threats are equal. Some are likely but minor; others are rare but catastrophic. We’ll map **likelihood vs. impact**, then prioritize mitigation.  

It’s risk triage time.
