# 📅 Day 13 – Risk Assessment Basics: Spotting Trouble Before It Strikes  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## 🔍 Topic Overview:

Today, we put on our detective hats and explored the basics of **risk assessment** — a core practice in any GRC or cybersecurity program. The purpose is to answer a simple but powerful question:  
> “What could go wrong with our systems, and how bad would it be?”

We learned that risk isn't random — it's the result of **a threat exploiting a vulnerability**, potentially causing **harm to an asset**. Understanding this relationship helps us anticipate, measure, and prioritize potential problems before they happen.

---

## 📚 Key Terms:

- **Asset** – Something valuable we want to protect (e.g., OpenMRS patient database)
- **Threat** – Anything that could cause harm to the asset (e.g., hacker, malware, power outage)
- **Vulnerability** – A weakness that can be exploited by a threat (e.g., weak password, outdated software)
- **Risk** – The potential impact and likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability

> 📌 **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability impacting an Asset**

---

## 🧠 Simple Risk Assessment Process:

1. **Identify Assets**  
   → What are we protecting?  
   *Example: OpenMRS server, patient database, clinician login credentials*

2. **Identify Threats & Vulnerabilities**  
   → What could go wrong? What weaknesses exist?  
   *Examples: Hackers (threat) + outdated software (vulnerability)*

3. **Analyze Risk**  
   → For each scenario, rate **Likelihood** and **Impact** as High/Medium/Low.  
   *Example: Likelihood = Medium, Impact = High → Overall Risk = High*

4. **Prioritize**  
   → Address High risks first. Document and monitor Medium/Low risks.

## 🏥 OpenMRS Risk Scenario – Hands-On Exercise:

### ✅ Asset: OpenMRS Patient Database  
**Threat:** Unauthorized access by external hacker  
**Vulnerability:** Default admin password not changed  

> 🔐 **Risk Rating:**  
- **Likelihood:** High (default passwords are easy to exploit)  
- **Impact:** High (exposes sensitive patient data)  
- **Overall Risk:** **High**  

📝 *This scenario shows how even a small oversight like a default password can lead to serious consequences.*

---

## 💡 Reflection:

Today’s exercise made me realize how **small vulnerabilities**, like weak credentials or missing patches, can have **large impacts** when paired with real-world threats. I also see that **risk assessment is everywhere** — not just in IT. Even planning a group event or deploying a new feature involves asking, “What could go wrong?” and “How do we reduce that chance?”

> This process helps us **move from reactive firefighting to proactive risk planning**, especially for systems as critical as OpenMRS.

Additional example:
- **Asset:** OpenMRS cloud hosting platform  
- **Threat:** Cloud outage  
- **Vulnerability:** No backup or failover configured  
- **Risk:** Medium (could be mitigated with a backup strategy)
