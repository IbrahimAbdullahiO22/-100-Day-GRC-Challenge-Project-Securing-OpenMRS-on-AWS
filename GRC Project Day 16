# 📅 Day 16 – Cloud Security 101 – Shared Responsibility with AWS  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## ☁️ Topic Overview:

Today’s focus is on **cloud security fundamentals** and understanding the **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**. When using cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host systems like **OpenMRS**, it’s crucial to understand **who is responsible for what** when it comes to securing the environment.

- **AWS is responsible** for securing the cloud infrastructure.  
- **We (the customer)** are responsible for securing what we put *in* the cloud — like applications, operating systems, and data.

> _Think of it like renting an apartment: AWS secures the building, but you must lock your apartment door and safeguard your belongings._

## 🏥 Real-World Context: OpenMRS in the Cloud

OpenMRS, when deployed on AWS (e.g., using EC2 or S3), benefits from AWS’s powerful infrastructure — but **our configuration and operational decisions** determine the real-world security outcomes.

### ✅ AWS Handles:
- Physical security at data centers (guards, cameras, power redundancy)  
- Maintenance of networking hardware and virtualization layers

### ✅ Customer Handles:
- OS and application patching (e.g., updating OpenMRS and Ubuntu)  
- Firewall rules, access controls, and data encryption  
- User authentication and secure storage practices

> _A misconfigured security group, unpatched system, or open S3 bucket could lead to a breach — and that would be **our** responsibility, not AWS’s._

---

## ✍️ Hands-On Exercise:

**Example Responsibilities:**

- ✅ **AWS Task**: Ensures physical security and controlled access to its data centers  
- ✅ **Customer Task**: Configures security groups to control traffic to OpenMRS EC2 instances

These examples reinforce that while AWS lifts a huge burden, **we must remain vigilant** in securing our deployments.

## 💡 Reflection:

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model has **increased my trust** in cloud platforms — knowing AWS handles the infrastructure gives peace of mind. However, it also underscores the need for **continuous vigilance on our part**. Misconfigurations, weak access controls, or forgotten updates can still expose sensitive patient data.

For OpenMRS and other healthcare systems, **shared responsibility doesn't mean less responsibility — it means smarter responsibility.** We must actively manage what’s inside our cloud environments.
