#  Day 24 â€“ Big-Picture Risks: Enterprise Risk Assessment for MyClinic  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

##  Topic Overview:

Today, we elevated our perspective from individual systems to **enterprise-level risk**.  
We explored how leaders in healthcare organizations like **MyClinic** conduct **organizational risk assessments** â€” identifying major threats that could disrupt not just IT, but the **entire mission of patient care**.

> As a future GRC leader, I see this as moving from **fixing whatâ€™s broken** to **anticipating what could break us**.

##  What Is an Enterprise Risk Assessment?

An **Enterprise Risk Assessment** evaluates risks across departments, operations, and technology to answer:

- What could stop us from delivering safe, quality care?
- Where do the most critical risks intersect?
- How should we prioritize mitigation based on **impact** and **likelihood**?

Per **NIST SP 800-37 (Task P-3)**, this is part of the **Prepare** step â€” a proactive process that aligns risk awareness with strategic planning and resource allocation.

##  Hands-On Exercise (Leadership View):

### 1. **Clinical/Operational Risk:**
> **Patient care interruption due to OpenMRS system downtime during clinical hours**

- *Impact*: Clinicians may be unable to access allergy histories or medication records, resulting in care delays or medical errors.
- *Why itâ€™s enterprise-level*: This directly jeopardizes patient safety â€” the **core mission** of the hospital.

### 2. **IT/Cybersecurity Risk:**
> **Ransomware attack on the hospital network encrypts OpenMRS and other critical systems**

- *Impact*: Operational shutdown, legal exposure under HIPAA, reputational damage.
- *Why itâ€™s enterprise-level*: Disrupts not just systems, but trust, compliance, and financial stability.

##  Reflection (Leadership Insight):

Although these risks come from different angles, they are **deeply connected**:

- A **technical failure** (ransomware or downtime) leads to **clinical consequences**.
- A **clinical error** could expose the organization to **legal or compliance risk**.

> As a leader, I see clearly: **IT and clinical teams cannot work in silos.** Enterprise risk demands cross-functional awareness and collaboration.

Hospital executives need **one unified view** â€” not fragmented reports â€” to make informed decisions about risk, budget, and policy.

---

##  Strategic Takeaway:

- **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)** isn't about documenting every possible threat.  
Itâ€™s about **surfacing the risks that matter most** to your mission â€” then assigning owners, making decisions, and allocating resources accordingly.

- When risk managers, IT, clinical staff, and compliance officers all contribute to this big-picture view, we create **organizational resilience**, not just technical safeguards.
