#  Day 18 – Handling Patient Data in the Cloud: Compliance & Best Practices  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

##  Topic Overview:

Today I explored how to manage **regulated healthcare data** in the cloud — specifically **Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI)** under compliance rules like **HIPAA**.

Using AWS to host platforms like **OpenMRS** means leveraging powerful cloud services while also being accountable for data privacy and security. This entry focuses on **compliance requirements**, **AWS support**, and **best security practices**.

---

##  Key Compliance Concepts:

- **HIPAA** requires a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** when third parties like AWS handle PHI.
- AWS offers a **HIPAA BAA** through the **AWS Artifact portal**, enabling healthcare orgs to use certain HIPAA-eligible services securely.
- Even with a BAA in place, **you (the customer)** are responsible for securely configuring your resources.

---

##  Cloud Security Best Practices:

- **Encryption**  
  - At Rest: Enable encryption on **RDS**, **S3**, and **EBS** volumes.  
  - In Transit: Use **HTTPS** and **TLS** to encrypt data during transfer.

- **Access Control & Auditing**  
  - Use **IAM roles and policies** to enforce least-privilege access.  
  - Enable **AWS CloudTrail** for auditing access and changes.

- **Network Security**  
  - Host OpenMRS in **private subnets** where possible.  
  - Use **VPNs** for administrative access.  
  - Implement **AWS WAF**, **Shield**, and **Config** to guard against misconfigurations and attacks.

- **Operational Processes**  
  - Enforce regular **audits**, security reviews, and maintain **documentation**.  
  - Follow **configuration baselines** to prevent common mistakes like open S3 buckets or default passwords.

>  *Many cloud breaches result from misconfigurations – not hackers. GRC helps prevent this by introducing structure, policies, and controls.*

## 🛠 Hands-On Exercise:

I researched how to obtain the **AWS HIPAA BAA**.   
- You can access it via **AWS Artifact**, the compliance portal.  
- Just search “AWS HIPAA BAA” and follow steps to review and accept it.

This simple task helped me build the habit of researching cloud compliance requirements – a key GRC skill.

---

##  Reflection:

Between technical and administrative responsibilities, I find the **technical steps** (like IAM and encryption configurations) more challenging — but both are essential.

Understanding your strengths and areas for growth is important in developing a balanced GRC skillset.
