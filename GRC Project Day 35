# ðŸ“… Day 35 â€“ Classifying the Lifeblood of OpenMRS: Information Types

## ðŸ§  GRC Leadership Insight: You Canâ€™t Secure What You Havenâ€™t Classified

As I lead this project forward, todayâ€™s focus sharpened my mindset around **data-centric risk governance**. In healthcare systems like OpenMRS, data is more than digitalâ€”itâ€™s deeply human. It represents lives, care decisions, medical histories, and futures. Thatâ€™s why **Task P-12** of NIST RMF is a critical checkpoint: **identifying and categorizing the information types** within our system.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

Classifying data isnâ€™t just paperwork â€” it drives protection. It helps us:

- Understand **what** weâ€™re protecting
- Determine **how sensitive** the data is
- Decide **which controls** are appropriate (encryption, access, retention)
- Prepare for **impact analysis** under NIST SP 800-60

## ðŸ§¾ My OpenMRS Info-Type Inventory (Leadership Perspective)

| Information Type                  | Description                                                                 | Sensitivity  | Risk Consideration                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Patient Personal Information**  | Names, MRNs, contact details, IDs (PII & PHI)                                  | High         | Identity theft, privacy violation                       |
| **2. Clinical Health Data**         | Diagnoses, medications, lab results, visit notes (core PHI)                   | High         | Misdiagnosis risk, legal exposure, regulatory fines     |
| **3. User Account & Audit Info**    | Usernames, roles, activity logs, privileges                                  | Medium-High  | Insider threat, privilege abuse, system impersonation   |
| **4. Billing/Insurance Records**    | Payment details, codes, insurance numbers                                    | Medium       | Fraud risk, regulatory compliance (PCI, HIPAA)          |
| **5. Metadata & Config Files**      | Drug formularies, system settings, coded lists                               | Low-Medium   | Operational integrity issues if tampered                |
| **6. Analytics/De-Identified Reports** | Trend reports, population metrics                                            | Low-High*    | Low risk unless re-identifiable                         |

> ðŸ”’ *Note: Even aggregated data must be evaluated for re-identification risk when cross-referenced with other datasets.*

## ðŸ§  Reflection as a Future CISO

This exercise reminded me that **information governance isnâ€™t static** â€” it must evolve with use cases. A report may start as harmless, but gain risk if it includes sensitive flags or rare conditions.

Every data type has a lifecycle, and **risk follows data** wherever it flows. Classifying upfront sets the tone for how we manage encryption, access control, and audit readiness across the board.

---

## ðŸ§° Next Action Steps

As part of building our OpenMRS Security Strategy, Iâ€™ll now:

- Tag data types with impact ratings per NIST SP 800-60
- Ensure PHI and clinical data are encrypted in storage and transit
- Limit access to sensitive records using RBAC
- Build in alerts around unusual access to high-risk data types
