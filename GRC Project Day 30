##  GRC Leadership Insight: Security Isn‚Äôt Static ‚Äì It‚Äôs Ongoing

Today, I tackled **Task P-7** of the NIST Risk Management Framework: building a **continuous monitoring strategy** for OpenMRS ‚Äì our cloud-based electronic medical record system.

One-time security checks aren‚Äôt enough. In today‚Äôs threat landscape, vigilance must be **constant, structured, and intelligent**.

##  What Is Continuous Monitoring?

According to **NIST SP 800-137**, continuous monitoring means maintaining ongoing awareness of security posture to support risk-informed decisions. In practice, it includes:

-  **Regular vulnerability scans**
-  **Security log collection and alerting**
-  **Threat detection tools (e.g., GuardDuty)**
-  **Periodic access reviews and configuration audits**
-  **Automated anomaly detection**

It's about **transitioning from static checklists to dynamic, real-time protection**.

##  OpenMRS: A High-Impact System Deserving Ongoing Oversight

As a GRC leader planning the long-term defense of OpenMRS in AWS, here's what I‚Äôd prioritize in our monitoring playbook:

** User Login Behavior Monitoring**  
> _"I‚Äôd implement a SIEM solution to flag unusual login patterns ‚Äî like repeated failures or access outside business hours ‚Äî as early indicators of account compromise."_  

** Monthly Vulnerability Scanning**  
> _"Run monthly authenticated Nessus scans against OpenMRS workloads to detect emerging CVEs, patch gaps, or insecure configs before attackers find them."_  

** Backup Validation Checks**  
> _"Automate testing to ensure that encrypted backups run nightly and can be restored cleanly."_  

**üîß Log Review Automation via AWS CloudWatch & GuardDuty**  
> _"Aggregate OpenMRS logs using CloudWatch and activate GuardDuty to detect port scans, brute force attempts, and misconfigurations across AWS resources."_

## üéØ Why This Matters

Continuous monitoring is how we go from **security by hope** to **security by design and discipline**.

> ‚ÄúAs GRC professionals, our job isn‚Äôt just to build secure systems ‚Äî it‚Äôs to ensure they **stay secure** in an evolving threat landscape.‚Äù

Proactive monitoring brings confidence to leadership, assurance to clinicians, and protection to patients.

##  Strategic Reflections

 Having a robust monitoring strategy in place transforms our security posture from reactive to predictive.

 Challenge: Avoid alert fatigue. Tune thresholds, group alerts, and assign clear ownership for follow-up.

 Leadership Takeaway: **Continuous monitoring is a leadership commitment** ‚Äî not a technical add-on.
