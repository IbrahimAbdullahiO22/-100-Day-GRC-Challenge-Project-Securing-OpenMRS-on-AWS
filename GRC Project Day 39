##  From Uncertainty to Assurance: Mapping Security & Privacy Requirements for Healthcare Systems

Early in my IT journey, I worked with student records protected by **FERPA**—a foundational experience that showed me how seriously we must treat sensitive information. As I began transitioning into healthcare-focused GRC, I realized that **the stakes are even higher**.

If Day 38 was about identifying what *could* go wrong with OpenMRS, then today is about ensuring we **do what’s right**—not just in theory, but by law, policy, and best practice.

---

## 🎯 Goals for Today

- Identify the **external laws** and regulations (like HIPAA) that OpenMRS must comply with  
- Map out **internal organizational policies** that shape our requirements  
- Reference **industry frameworks** like NIST SP 800-53 to standardize our control approach  
- Translate all this into a **concrete set of security and privacy requirements** for OpenMRS  

---

## 📚 Real Talk: Where Do These Rules Come From?

As GRC leaders, we don’t get to set the rules—we get to **align technology with them**. Today I reviewed three key sources:

### 🏛️ 1. Laws & Regulations

- **HIPAA Security & Privacy Rules** (if handling U.S. patient data)
  - Access control
  - Audit logging
  - Encryption in transit and at rest
  - Contingency planning (backup, disaster recovery)

- **GDPR** (if in EU context)
  - Consent-based data use
  - Right to access, delete, or correct personal data

- **Local privacy laws** (e.g., India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Bill)

> 🔍 *Example*: “Encrypt all ePHI stored in OpenMRS’s MySQL database and enforce HTTPS on all endpoints.”  
*— HIPAA-inspired requirement*

---

### 🏢 2. Organizational Policies

Healthcare orgs may have specific internal security policies such as:

- MFA for all clinician logins  
- Timeout and session lock after X minutes of inactivity  
- Mandatory annual security awareness training  

> 🔍 *Example*: “System must support MFA through SSO integration.”  
*— Org Policy Requirement*

---

### 📘 3. Industry Frameworks

We lean on **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5**, **ISO 27001**, or even **COBIT**, not just for checklists, but to bring structure and industry-validated guidance.

> 🔍 *Example*: “Implement audit logging (AU-2) and access reviews (AC-6).”  
*— NIST 800-53 control reference*

## ✅ What We’re Requiring from OpenMRS (Highlights)

| Requirement | Source | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| All patient data must be encrypted at rest and in transit | HIPAA | AWS RDS encryption + HTTPS on frontend |
| Only authorized users may access patient data | HIPAA / Org Policy | Role-based access control (RBAC) setup in OpenMRS |
| Maintain audit logs for all patient data access events | HIPAA / NIST AU-2 | Enable logging and secure retention of logs |
| MFA must be enabled for remote access | Org Policy | Use OpenMRS integration with SSO provider |
| Backups must be encrypted and tested monthly | Org Policy / HIPAA | Use AWS S3 with encryption and test recovery |
| Compliance documentation must be retained for 6 years | HIPAA | Store risk assessments, training records, etc. |

---

## 🤔 Reflection: What’s the Hardest Requirement?

For me, the **challenge isn’t technical**—it’s **cultural**.  
Getting end users (clinicians, admins) to embrace controls like MFA, logging, or access restrictions can be met with resistance.  
In a healthcare environment, speed is everything. But **security is non-negotiable**.

So our job is to lead with **clarity**, **training**, and **automation**—we meet the standard *without* slowing down care.

---

## 📌 Why This Matters

This phase is the **backbone of compliance**. If we miss a HIPAA requirement now, no fancy security tool will fix that later. As leaders, we must **document, communicate, and enforce** clear requirements before diving into control selection.

In GRC, prevention always beats reaction.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Snapshot

- 🎯 Found HIPAA’s Security Rule online and extracted three technical safeguards  
- 🧠 Reviewed OpenMRS security docs to match system capabilities with required features  
- 📋 Created a preliminary **requirement list** tagged by source (HIPAA, NIST, Org Policy)

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

Tomorrow we zoom out and talk **enterprise architecture** — how OpenMRS fits into the broader MyClinic IT landscape. We’ll explore interoperability, security boundaries, and how to ensure systems play nicely in a regulated, cloud-first environment.
