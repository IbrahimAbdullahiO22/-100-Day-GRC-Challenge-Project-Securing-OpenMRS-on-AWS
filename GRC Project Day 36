# 📅 Day 36 – The Life of a Patient Record: Understanding the Information Life Cycle in OpenMRS

## 🧭 Leading with Data Integrity from Creation to Deletion

Every record has a story.

Today, I guided our GRC journey through one of the most overlooked yet vital elements in healthcare IT governance — the **Information Life Cycle**.

In OpenMRS, a patient’s record is more than just data — it represents care, privacy, trust, and safety. From the moment a record is created to the day it is safely disposed, it must be **nurtured, protected, and governed**. This is where strategy meets stewardship.

## 📖 A Patient Record's Journey (OpenMRS Cloud Deployment)

Let me walk you through the path of data — not as an admin, but as a leader mapping risk with purpose:

### 1. **Creation (Collection)**
A nurse registers a new patient. Vital information is entered into OpenMRS: name, contact, date of birth, initial medical history.  
🔐 **Leadership Lens:** Are we collecting only what’s necessary? Is data encrypted in transit? Are staff trained on input security?

---

### 2. **Use & Update (Maintenance)**
Doctors update diagnoses, nurses record prescriptions, lab results come in — the record evolves.  
📊 **Leadership Lens:** Are access controls role-based? Is every access logged? Are APIs secure when sharing with external systems?

---

### 3. **Storage (Retention)**
Records remain in the database for years. Daily backups ensure resilience.  
🗄️ **Leadership Lens:** Are backups encrypted? Is there a retention policy in place? Do we test data restoration regularly?

---

### 4. **Archival (Long-Term Storage)**
The patient hasn’t visited in 10+ years. The record is archived.  
📦 **Leadership Lens:** Is archived data segregated and protected? Are we treating “forgotten” data with the same rigor?

---

### 5. **Disposal (Deletion)**
Records reach the end of their lifecycle. The law requires deletion.  
🔥 **Leadership Lens:** Are we following NIST SP 800-53 MP-6 for secure data destruction? Are cloud backups purged too?

---

## 🔐 Why This Matters

Data doesn’t just exist. It **moves**, it **grows**, it **rests**, and eventually, it **dies**.

As a GRC leader, I recognize that **information governance isn't just about technology — it's about timing, training, and trust**. Most breaches occur at the edges — when no one’s looking at the archive, or assuming deletion means irretrievable.

Understanding the life cycle ensures we apply the right protections at the right time. We plan for **cradle-to-grave** security.  

> Because in healthcare, failure to manage a record’s journey is more than a technical error — it’s a breach of care.

## 💬 Reflection:  
Where does your organization’s data life cycle fall short?  
For many, it’s the end. Disposal is an afterthought. But poor sanitization is a backdoor waiting to be opened.  

**My next action as a GRC practitioner:**  
- Implement quarterly data lifecycle audits  
- Review our backup destruction policy  
- Deliver staff training on secure data deletion
