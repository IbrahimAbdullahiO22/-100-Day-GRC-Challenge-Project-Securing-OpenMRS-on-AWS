# 📅 Day 3 – Risk Management: Detecting and Defending Against What Could Go Wrong  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## 🔍 Topic Overview:

Today we explored **Risk Management**, the "R" in GRC. It’s the proactive process of identifying what can go wrong and making informed decisions on how to respond. Risk management combines **detective work** (identifying threats and vulnerabilities) with **forecasting** (estimating the likelihood and impact of incidents).

To break it down:
- **Threat** = Something bad that *could* happen (e.g., a hacker, ransomware, accidental data leak)
- **Vulnerability** = A weakness that allows the threat to succeed (e.g., weak password, outdated software)
- **Risk** = Threat × Vulnerability → How likely the bad thing is, and how bad the damage would be

> 📌 **Formula: Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

---

## 🏥 Real-World Context:

Let’s use our ongoing **OpenMRS case** for clarity.

> A clinic runs OpenMRS on a cloud server. They delay critical software updates (vulnerability). Hackers are targeting healthcare systems (threat).  
> **Risk**: High likelihood + high impact = urgent concern.

A breach here could expose **thousands of patient records**, lead to regulatory fines, downtime, lawsuits, and most importantly, **jeopardize patient care**. This scenario is a real-world demonstration of why **risk must be assessed and prioritized regularly**.

Another example:  
- Threat: Power outage  
- Vulnerability: No backup generator  
- Risk: Low-to-moderate (if data is backed up and in the cloud)

## ✍️ Hands-On Exercise:

### ✅ Mini Risk Brainstorm (Based on real-world roles)

| Threat                                         | Vulnerability                                       | Likelihood | Impact |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|--------|
| Ransomware attack                             | Unpatched endpoint & outdated antivirus            | High       | High   |
| Insider mistakenly emails PHI to wrong person | No DLP (Data Loss Prevention) or auto-checking     | Medium     | High   |
| Server crash during storm                     | No redundant backups or power supply               | Medium     | Medium |
| Phishing email clicked by employee            | Lack of security awareness training                | High       | High   |

🔍 **Highest-risk item:**  
Ransomware + unpatched systems — scores high on **both likelihood and impact**, and would disrupt operations, lock data, and expose PHI. This risk should be **prioritized for mitigation** (e.g., patching, backups, endpoint protection).

## 💡 Reflection:

A few years ago, I almost clicked on a phishing email that looked convincingly like it came from HR. It asked me to "review my bonus details." I hesitated and reported it — IT confirmed it was fake.  
At the time, I didn’t consider myself a target. But it made me realize: **we underestimate threats until we almost get hit**. Had I clicked, malware might have been installed, or credentials stolen. The **impact** would have been huge — for me and the organization.

That near miss helped me internalize the **importance of ongoing awareness** and how **every employee plays a part** in risk mitigation.
