# 📅 Day 23 – What’s Your Risk Appetite? Crafting a Risk Management Strategy  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## 🎯 Topic Overview:

Today’s focus was on developing a **Risk Management Strategy**, including defining our organization’s **risk tolerance**. This sets the tone for all future risk decisions and aligns security efforts with business values.

In leadership, understanding and documenting risk tolerance isn’t just a compliance checkbox — it’s about empowering decision-makers at all levels to act consistently and wisely when risk arises.

##  What Is a Risk Management Strategy?

- It defines **how** your organization approaches risk: its priorities, boundaries, and decision-making process.
- It includes the **level of risk** the organization is willing to accept (aka **risk tolerance** or **risk appetite**).
- NIST SP 800-37 (Task P-2) recommends this be formalized before diving into system-specific actions.

> “Risk tolerance is the degree of uncertainty an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives.” – NIST

##  OpenMRS Case Example:

###  Example Risk Tolerance Statement for MyClinic:
> “We have **zero tolerance** for any risk that could result in the unauthorized disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) or compromise patient safety.”

**Why it matters:**  
In healthcare, the stakes are life and death. Data confidentiality and system availability directly affect **trust**, **safety**, and **compliance** (e.g., HIPAA).

MyClinic may accept some operational or financial risk (e.g., minor project delays, resource constraints), but not if it endangers patients or exposes sensitive data.

---

##  Hands-On Exercise:

**Drafted Risk Tolerance Statement (as a leader):**

> “Our organization maintains **zero tolerance** for security risks that compromise patient data confidentiality, and **minimal tolerance** for operational interruptions during critical clinical hours.”

This statement clearly outlines where **no risk is allowed** and where **limited risk may be accepted** for functionality or performance.

---

##  Reflection Prompt:

**Why is this risk intolerable?**

As a leader, protecting **human life and dignity** must come first. A breach of PHI can result in **loss of patient trust**, **legal consequences**, and **irreversible harm** to our mission and community reputation.

**Where is risk acceptable?**

We recognize some **technical debt** and **operational risk** may be necessary to innovate or maintain services — such as tolerating scheduled downtimes or minor feature delays.

> Having a written risk tolerance strategy ensures **every team** — from IT to executive leadership — can make **consistent and principled decisions**, even under pressure.

---

##  Leadership Insight:

- A documented strategy enables **proactive governance**, rather than reactive crisis management.
- Leaders must balance **mission-critical risk intolerance** with **real-world resource constraints**.
- Clear boundaries reduce decision fatigue and support accountability at all levels.
