# üìÖ Day 22 ‚Äì Who‚Äôs Who in Risk Management (Establishing RMF Roles)  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

## üéØ Topic Overview:

Today marks the first action in the **Prepare** step of the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** ‚Äî defining **key roles** in the risk management process.

Roles like the **Authorizing Official (AO)**, **System Owner**, and **Information System Security Officer (ISSO)** create structure, accountability, and efficiency. Without clearly assigned roles, risk decisions become unclear and critical tasks may be neglected.

---

## üë• Key RMF Roles in Plain Language:

### üõ°Ô∏è Authorizing Official (AO):
- **Who**: Senior executive (e.g., CIO or IT Director)
- **What They Do**: Approves the system for operation by accepting the level of risk  
- **In Our OpenMRS Case**: Likely the **Hospital CIO** or **Clinic Director**
- **Note**: Must have authority and independence from day-to-day operations to avoid conflicts of interest

---

### üñ•Ô∏è System Owner:
- **Who**: Manager responsible for OpenMRS (e.g., Head of Health IT or EHR Project Manager)
- **What They Do**: Manages system lifecycle, coordinates implementation of security controls
- **In Our Case**: Likely the **Health IT Manager** at MyClinic

---

### üîê Information System Security Officer (ISSO):
- **Who**: Security-focused individual (e.g., Infosec Lead or Security Engineer)
- **What They Do**: Oversees the implementation and assessment of security controls, prepares documentation and reports
- **In Our Case**: Likely the **Infosec Lead or Compliance Officer** for MyClinic

> üîÑ These roles interact throughout the RMF process ‚Äî from planning and implementation to approval and monitoring.

## ‚úÖ Hands-On Exercise:

**Who would approve the Authority to Operate (ATO) for OpenMRS?**

‚û°Ô∏è **Answer**: The **Chief Information Officer (CIO)** at MyClinic would likely be the Authorizing Official (AO).  
They have the executive authority to accept residual risk and approve the system for production use.

## üí¨ Reflection Prompt:

**Why is it important to designate RMF roles early?**

‚û°Ô∏è Clearly defining roles creates **accountability** and ensures no critical tasks are overlooked.  
> ‚ÄúIf everyone knows who‚Äôs in charge of what, then decisions are made faster, gaps are closed sooner, and risks are managed intentionally.‚Äù

**What could go wrong if roles weren‚Äôt clearly assigned?**

- Missed deadlines due to confusion over responsibility  
- No one updating or enforcing security controls  
- Risks being accepted by default, without formal approval  
- Increased likelihood of compliance failures or security incidents
