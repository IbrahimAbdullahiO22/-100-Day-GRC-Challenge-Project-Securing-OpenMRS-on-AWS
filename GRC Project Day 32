##  Leadership Insight: Security Starts with People

In today’s Risk Management Framework focus (Task P-9), I shifted from technical assets to **human assets** — because **no system exists in isolation from its people**. As a cybersecurity leader, I know this: to secure a system like OpenMRS effectively, we must first know **who we’re securing it for, who’s running it, and who’s accountable for its outcomes**.

That means mapping out stakeholders — and more importantly, understanding their priorities.

## 🧩 Stakeholder Mapping for OpenMRS

Here’s my leadership-level breakdown of critical stakeholder roles for OpenMRS:

- ** Developers & Implementers**  
  *Focus*: Functionality, code stability, and integrations  
  *Why they matter*: They build the foundation; security must be embedded from day one.

- **🩺 Clinicians (Doctors/Nurses)**  
  *Focus*: Ease of use, speed, and data availability  
  *Why they matter*: They're the frontline users; poor UX or downtime equals care disruption.

- **🛠️ IT Administrators**  
  *Focus*: System uptime, patching, backups, and support  
  *Why they matter*: They keep the system alive; their insights influence operational risk.

- **📊 Executives & Compliance Officers**  
  *Focus*: Strategic value, risk exposure, cost-benefit, legal compliance  
  *Why they matter*: They approve funding and policy — you need their buy-in to implement change.

- **🌍 Community & Technology Partners (e.g., AWS, OpenMRS community)**  
  *Focus*: Ecosystem growth, infrastructure security, patch lifecycle  
  *Why they matter*: OpenMRS doesn’t exist in a silo. These contributors shape its evolution.

## 💡 Why This Matters for GRC

Every role represents **a different risk perspective**. Ignoring any of them means introducing blind spots in your threat model.  
As a GRC professional and future leader in digital health security, I make it a priority to **translate technical controls into stakeholder value**.

For example:
- **Clinician feedback** → Usability flaws → May expose data to accidental disclosure  
- **Executive risk appetite** → Defines how strict or lean we are on control selection  
- **IT support gaps** → Signal weak monitoring or delayed incident response  

Understanding these interconnections helps me **proactively shape policies, not just reactively defend systems**.

## ✍️ My Stakeholder Engagement Plan

- **Action**: Create a stakeholder matrix for OpenMRS, including concerns and communication preferences  
- **Priority**: Increase visibility and voice of end users (clinicians), often overlooked during control selection  
- **Leadership Lesson**: A successful GRC strategy is not just technical — it’s **relational and inclusive**.
