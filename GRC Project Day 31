## 🎯 GRC Leadership Insight: Mission First, Security Always

Before we select controls or conduct risk assessments, we must ask a foundational question:

> **"Why does this system exist?"**

Today, as part of **Task P-8** in the NIST RMF, I stepped back from technical tasks to focus on the **mission and business purpose** of OpenMRS — a critical step in ensuring that our security decisions are always anchored in **organizational impact and human value**.

---

##  OpenMRS Mission Statement

**“OpenMRS exists to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments by providing a robust, open-source electronic medical record platform.”**

This mission isn't about code.  
It's about **saving lives**, **supporting clinicians**, and **scaling equity in global health** through technology.

---

## 💡 Why Mission Clarity Matters in GRC

Understanding a system’s mission helps us:

-  Align security controls with **real-world risk**
-  Prioritize availability where patient outcomes depend on uptime
-  Justify investments in privacy and integrity safeguards
-  Communicate the *why* behind GRC efforts to non-technical leaders

When patient outcomes, clinician workflows, and community trust are on the line, **every control we implement must serve that mission**.

---

##  Leadership Takeaway

Security without purpose is noise.  
But when tied to mission, it becomes **strategic action**.

> "As a GRC leader, I don’t just protect systems — I protect the mission they serve."

OpenMRS is more than software.  
It's a lifeline for clinics that can't afford failure.  
**That’s why GRC isn’t optional — it’s essential.**

---

##  Reflection

Crafting a one-line mission taught me this:  
When security feels overwhelming, **return to the mission**.  
That’s your north star. That’s how you lead.
