## 🧭 Today’s Focus: From Risk Awareness to Risk Accountability

Leadership isn’t just about seeing the risks — it’s about **systematically managing** them.  
Today, I applied that mindset by building and documenting my first **Risk Register** entry as part of Task P-3 in the NIST RMF.

> "What gets tracked, gets managed. What gets ignored, becomes a threat."

## 🧠 What Is a Risk Register?

A **Risk Register** is a central place where all known risks are logged and reviewed.  
It helps organizations move from reactive to **proactive** — identifying risk early, assigning ownership, and tracking mitigation.

### Why It’s Critical for Leaders:
- Aligns teams around shared risk awareness  
- Creates **accountability** for each risk  
- Enables informed decisions at the executive level  
- Bridges **technical, clinical, and operational** risk views

In short, it turns fear into **actionable strategy**.

## 🏥 Sample Risk Register Entry – MyClinic (OpenMRS Case)

| Field              | Entry                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Risk Name**      | Prolonged OpenMRS Downtime During Clinic Hours                        |
| **Impact**         | **High** – Prevents access to patient records, risking care quality   |
| **Likelihood**     | **Medium** – Single internet failure or cloud outage could trigger it |
| **Mitigation**     | Secondary internet connection, offline chart exports, provider SLAs   |
| **Owner**          | Director of IT Infrastructure                                          |
| **Status**         | Contingency plan drafted; testing scheduled quarterly                 |

This risk touches both **technology** and **patient care**, showing the **interdependence** that enterprise leaders must constantly evaluate.

## 🔍 Reflection as a Future GRC Leader

Creating this entry forced me to:
- Think **holistically** (not just about the system, but its business impact)
- Identify a clear **owner** (who ensures follow-through)
- Consider **ongoing visibility** (status updates, reviews, etc.)

> "Good risk management isn't about eliminating all risk — it's about making risk **visible, owned, and understood.**"

I see the **Risk Register** as a leadership tool — not a checkbox exercise.  
It enables collaboration across departments and keeps risk conversations grounded in facts, not fear.

✅ **Tomorrow: Day 26 – Tailored Control Baselines**  
We’ll learn how to fine-tune security controls for our system needs — adding what matters, removing what doesn’t. Leadership is about making **context-aware decisions**, and tailoring your controls is a powerful way to do that.
