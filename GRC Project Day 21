# 📅 Day 21 – Kicking off Phase 2: NIST RMF (Overview & Game Plan)  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

##  Topic Overview:

Welcome to **Phase 2** of the challenge — we’re diving into the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**.  
The RMF is a structured, step-by-step process for managing cybersecurity risk for information systems.  
Today’s goal was to understand the **7 RMF steps** and see how they apply to our **OpenMRS on AWS** scenario.

---

##  RMF in a Nutshell – 7 Steps (Simplified):

1. **Prepare** – Set the foundation at both the organization and system level (roles, policies, mission context).  
2. **Categorize** – Assess the system’s impact based on the sensitivity of data (e.g., PHI in OpenMRS = High confidentiality).  
3. **Select Controls** – Choose safeguards from NIST SP 800-53 tailored to the system's risk level.  
4. **Implement Controls** – Configure the system (AWS, OpenMRS) to apply those controls (e.g., encryption, IAM).  
5. **Assess Controls** – Verify the controls work through testing, audits, and scans.  
6. **Authorize the System** – Management reviews risk and decides whether the system can operate.  
7. **Monitor Controls** – Continuously check for threats, re-scan, and update controls as needed.

>  RMF is a **cycle**, not a one-time checklist — it adapts to evolving threats and environments.

##  Application to Our OpenMRS Case Study:

We’ll be applying each step to our cloud-hosted OpenMRS system:  
- When we **categorize**, we’ll classify PHI data  
- When we **select**, we’ll choose practical AWS security controls  
- When we **implement**, we’ll apply encryption, IAM roles, and backups  
- When we **assess**, we’ll simulate testing and audit logs  
- Eventually, we’ll walk through **authorization** and **monitoring** as well

Each RMF step will be mapped to **real-world actions** and artifacts.

##  Hands-On Exercise:

 **Found RMF Diagram** – I searched for **"NIST RMF steps diagram"** and found the official flowchart in **NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2**.  
Yes — I see the **loop**: Continuous Monitoring feeds back into other steps.

📍 **Where does OpenMRS need the most work?**  
➡️ I believe **Continuous Monitoring** will be the most resource-intensive step for OpenMRS because cloud environments evolve constantly.  
➡️ Also, **Selecting Controls** might be challenging due to the vast number of options and cloud-specific configurations.

---

##  Reflection Prompt:

**How do I feel about starting RMF?**  
✅ *Excited!* It’s structured and logical, and I like working with repeatable frameworks. But I also expect some complexity.

**Most Challenging Step for Me:**  
➡️ *Select Controls* — because of the depth of NIST SP 800-53 and deciding which controls fit our OpenMRS setup best.

**Most Exciting Step:**  
➡️ *Implement Controls* — I enjoy hands-on security tasks like enabling encryption, setting up IAM, and tightening configs.
