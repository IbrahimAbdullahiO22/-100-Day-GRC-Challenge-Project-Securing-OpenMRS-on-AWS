# üìÖ Day 19 ‚Äì Mapping GRC Skills to the ISC2 CGRC Certification  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

##  Topic Overview:

Today‚Äôs focus was all about **connecting what I‚Äôve learned so far** to a globally recognized credential:  
 **ISC2 CGRC** (Certified in Governance, Risk and Compliance)

This certification validates a professional's ability to **align security, compliance, and business objectives** ‚Äî exactly what we‚Äôve been doing with OpenMRS and cloud security in this challenge.

---

##  What Is CGRC?

The **CGRC** (formerly known as CAP ‚Äì Certified Authorization Professional) is issued by ISC2, the same organization behind CISSP. It‚Äôs ideal for professionals who work in:

- Governance & Compliance  
- Risk Management  
- System Authorization (e.g., RMF practitioners)  
- Security control selection & implementation  

CGRC focuses on integrating **security and compliance into business strategy** using frameworks like **NIST RMF**.

## üß© CGRC Domains & What I‚Äôve Covered:

| **Domain** | **What It Covers** | **Connection to This Challenge** |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1. Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance Program | Security and privacy program alignment with business | Days 1‚Äì5: Intro to GRC, risk, policies |
| 2. Scope of the System | Define boundaries, categorize data | OpenMRS architecture, sensitive data |
| 3. Selection of Security and Privacy Controls | Choosing appropriate safeguards | Encryption, IAM, HIPAA practices |
| 4. Implementation of Controls | Applying and configuring controls | Hands-on config: EC2, S3, RDS |
| 5. Assessment/Audit of Controls | Validate control effectiveness | Coming soon in RMF Phase 2 |
| 6. Authorization of the System | Risk sign-off and system approval | Aligns with governance decisions |
| 7. Continuous Monitoring (Compliance Maintenance) | Ongoing security management | Logging, updates, security checks |

>  *Everything I‚Äôve done so far is aligned with the CGRC exam blueprint ‚Äî even without realizing it!*

##  Quiz Time!

**Q: Which NIST RMF step involves selecting security controls?**  
 **Answer**: Step 2 ‚Äì **Select** (right after Categorize)

This is a direct connection to Domain 3 of CGRC. Questions like this test how well you apply GRC knowledge to real-world frameworks.

---

##  Reflection:

Am I planning to pursue CGRC? ‚úÖ Definitely considering it.  
Certifications like CGRC **build credibility**, **unlock opportunities**, and **validate hands-on knowledge** in GRC roles.

Whether you go for the cert or not, **understanding these domains** prepares you to lead in cybersecurity and compliance.
