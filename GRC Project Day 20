#  Day 20 – Wrapping Up Phase 1: GRC Lessons Learned & Ready for What’s Next  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

##  Topic Overview:

Today marks the **end of Phase 1** of my 100-day challenge. Over the past 19 days, I’ve learned and applied core **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** concepts — all grounded in a real-world healthcare use case with OpenMRS hosted in AWS. Today is about **reflection, recap**, and **preparing for Phase 2**.

---

##  Phase 1 Key Takeaways:

###  What GRC Really Means:
- **Governance** = Direction + Accountability (e.g., policies, leadership oversight)  
- **Risk Management** = Identifying and addressing potential threats  
- **Compliance** = Meeting legal/regulatory standards (e.g., HIPAA)  
> GRC brings all three together into a unified, proactive security approach.

---

###  Importance of a Risk-Based Approach:
- Not all risks are equal — prioritize based on **impact and likelihood**  
- Focus efforts on **high-value systems**, like patient data in OpenMRS  
- Prevent **checkbox compliance** by aligning controls with actual risks  

---

###  Frameworks & Standards Introduced:
- **NIST RMF** – a repeatable 7-step risk management process (Phase 2 focus)  
- **HIPAA** – governs handling of healthcare data  
- Others mentioned: **ISO 27001**, **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**  
> Frameworks are the “guardrails” that ensure structure and consistency.

---

###  Our OpenMRS Case Study:
- Explored how a clinic uses OpenMRS on **AWS**  
- Applied GRC concepts to **cloud security**, **data protection**, and **compliance**  
- Hands-on examples: encryption, IAM policies, BAA, backups, network segmentation  

---

###  Why It All Matters (Day 1 Breach Reflection):
- The opening breach scenario was caused by missing or weak GRC practices  
- **GRC in action** could have mitigated or prevented the breach:  
  - Clear governance → roles and policies defined  
  - Proactive risk management → vulnerabilities addressed  
  - Compliance → encryption, auditing, BAA in place  
> GRC isn’t just theory — it **prevents real-world failures**.

---

##  Hands-On Exercise:

**Day 1 Breach Prevention – My GRC Diagnosis:**

- **Risk Management Failure**: No encryption or access controls on patient data  
- **Governance Lapse**: No policy requiring regular patching or risk assessments  
- **Compliance Gap**: Failure to sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with AWS  

> A strong GRC foundation across these three areas could have stopped the breach.

---

##  Reflection Prompt:

**Which topic resonated most?**  
➡ *Cloud security practices* — they made the abstract concrete and taught me how to protect data in the real world.

**Why?**  
➡ Because cloud is the future, and understanding shared responsibility, encryption, IAM, and backups gave me confidence to secure modern systems.
