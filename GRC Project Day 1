_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## 🔍 Topic Overview:
Today, we begin our journey into the world of GRC: **Governance, Risk, and Compliance**. While these terms may sound like corporate buzzwords, they are vital practices that ensure organizations operate responsibly, safely, and within regulatory boundaries — especially in industries like **healthcare**, where protecting sensitive data directly impacts lives.

**Governance** sets the direction and rules.  
**Risk management** identifies and prepares for potential threats.  
**Compliance** ensures we follow industry and legal standards (like HIPAA in the U.S.).

---

## 🏥 Real-World Context:
Imagine a clinic using **OpenMRS**, an open-source electronic medical records system. A breach of this system could expose private patient data, leading to:

- Loss of **patient trust**
- **Regulatory penalties** and **fines**
- Long-term **reputational damage**
- Disruption of **clinical operations**

This scenario highlights the need for strong GRC practices to **prevent, detect, and respond** to security threats.

## ✍️ Hands-On Exercise:

**Breach Example Researched**: *HCA Healthcare Data Breach (2023)*  
- **Patients Affected**: Over **11 million** records leaked  
- **Cause**: Unauthorized access to an external storage location  
- **Consequences**: Public trust erosion, class-action lawsuits, major brand reputation hit

**Key Takeaways:**
- Sensitive data stored insecurely can have massive consequences
- Lack of proper governance over data storage and access was a key failure
- GRC frameworks could have helped mitigate or prevent this breach

## 💡 Reflection:

Security in healthcare is more than just an IT checkbox — it's about **protecting people**. When we give our data to doctors or clinics, we trust them to keep it safe. A failure in GRC processes doesn't just affect systems — it affects lives.  
That’s why **cybersecurity, risk management, and compliance** must work together to safeguard not only organizations but also the **dignity and safety of every individual**.
