# ðŸ“… Day 26 â€“ Custom-Fitting Your Security Controls (Tailored Baselines)
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

##  Leadership Focus: Smart Security = Relevant Security

Today, I adopted a powerful concept in strategic risk management â€” tailoring security control baselines.  
In the world of GRC, itâ€™s not just about checking boxes â€” itâ€™s about choosing **the right boxes** to check.

Security is not one-size-fits-all. As a future GRC leader in healthcare IT, Iâ€™m learning how to refine and optimize controls in ways that support both **security** and **operational agility**.

##  What Are Tailored Security Baselines?

Security control baselines are predefined sets of safeguards recommended for systems based on their impact level (e.g., Low, Moderate, High). For example, a Moderate baseline in NIST SP 800-53 might require ~300 controls.

**Tailoring** means:
-  **Removing** non-applicable controls
-  **Adding** necessary controls unique to your environment
-  **Justifying** each decision based on actual risk

It's like tailoring a suit for your system â€” fit it to the mission and environment, not the other way around.

##  Case Study: MyClinic + OpenMRS (Cloud Deployment on AWS)

### âœ” Tailoring Example â€“ Dropping Irrelevant Controls

**Control to Tailor Out**: Physical access controls (PE-family, e.g., CCTV in server room)

**Justification**:  
OpenMRS is hosted in the AWS cloud. MyClinic does not own or manage physical data centers.  
Physical security is **inherited from AWS** as part of the shared responsibility model.

ðŸ“Œ _Lesson_: Smart tailoring avoids wasted resources on controls that donâ€™t apply and focuses on what actually protects the system.

##  Reflection: The Leadership Balancing Act

As a future GRC strategist, I see tailoring as an exercise in **disciplined customization**.  
Done right, it creates **clarity**, **efficiency**, and **risk-aligned protection**.

But tailoring comes with responsibility:
- Every dropped control must be justified
- Risks must still be **fully mitigated**, even if addressed differently
- Decisions must stand up to **audit scrutiny** and leadership review

> As a leader, tailoring isnâ€™t about doing less.  
> Itâ€™s about doing what **matters most**, with clarity and accountability.

##  Quick Practice Entry

| Control Area                  | Action               | Justification                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Physical Server Protection   | Tailor OUT           | OpenMRS is cloud-hosted; physical security is inherited from AWS              |
| Removable Media Controls     | Tailor OUT           | Organizational policy prohibits USB or tape backups in the OpenMRS workflow   |
| Volunteer Staff Training     | Tailor IN (Add)      | Volunteers must also receive security briefings due to data access exposure   |
