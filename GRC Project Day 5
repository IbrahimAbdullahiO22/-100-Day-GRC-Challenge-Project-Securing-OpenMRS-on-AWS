# 📅 Day 5 – Putting It All Together: Governance, Risk & Compliance in Harmony  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## 🔍 Topic Overview:

Today marks the end of our first week in the 100-day GRC journey! We’re tying together the three pillars — **Governance**, **Risk**, and **Compliance** — into one unified, practical concept.

Think of GRC as a **three-legged stool**:  
- **Governance** sets the strategy  
- **Risk management** addresses threats and vulnerabilities  
- **Compliance** ensures the organization aligns with legal and regulatory standards

If one leg is weak or missing, the entire system falters. But when G, R, and C work together, the organization builds a **resilient and secure environment** — especially critical in industries like healthcare where lives and trust are on the line.

## 🏥 Real-World Case Study: Encryption in OpenMRS

Let’s walk through how GRC plays out in one decision — **encrypting patient data in OpenMRS**:

### **Governance (G)**  
Clinic leadership (CIO or board) decides to implement a **formal policy** requiring all patient data to be encrypted at rest and in transit. This directive shows top-level involvement, vision, and accountability.

### **Risk (R)**  
The risk being addressed is **data theft or loss**, either through system breaches or stolen devices. Encryption reduces the **impact** of such events by making data unreadable to unauthorized parties, thus **mitigating a high-priority risk**.

### **Compliance (C)**  
Encryption helps fulfill **HIPAA’s technical safeguard** requirements. If a breach happens but the data is encrypted, HIPAA may consider it a **non-reportable incident**, saving the organization from regulatory penalties and reputational damage.

✅ This single policy — driven by governance — reduces risk and meets compliance. That’s the **power of integrated GRC**.

## ✍️ Hands-On Exercise: GRC Triad Mapping

**Security Control Chosen:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for VPN Access

| GRC Element | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Governance** | The IT Security Team, approved by senior leadership, mandates MFA as part of the official Access Control Policy. |
| **Risk** | Mitigates the risk of **credential theft** and **unauthorized remote access**, especially from phishing attacks. Lowers both **likelihood and impact** of account compromise. |
| **Compliance** | MFA is often a **requirement** for compliance with NIST 800-53, HIPAA best practices, and even cyber insurance policies. |

🔍 This mapping makes it clear how a **single security measure** can fulfill multiple needs across the GRC spectrum.

## 💡 Reflection:

Looking back on this first week, I see that the area **often most neglected** is **Governance** — the leadership and policy-setting role. Many orgs (and individuals) focus on compliance checklists or react to risks without a clear, proactive **security vision** from the top.

Personally, I’m drawn to the **Risk Management** side — analyzing threats, mapping out likelihood vs. impact, and helping leaders make informed decisions. It feels like strategic problem-solving that protects real people.

Moving forward, I aim to **strengthen governance practices** wherever I contribute — by advocating for clear security policies, involving leadership, and aligning actions with long-term organizational goals.
