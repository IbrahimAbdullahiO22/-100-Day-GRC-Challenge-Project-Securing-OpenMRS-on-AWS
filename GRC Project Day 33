## 🔐 GRC Leadership Insight: If You Don't Know What You Have, You Can't Protect It

Today’s lesson reinforced a foundational truth in Governance, Risk, and Compliance: **Asset visibility is everything.**  

In Task P-10 of the NIST RMF, we zero in on **asset identification** — the critical step before any real risk management can begin. You can’t classify, monitor, or protect what you haven’t mapped. For a system like **OpenMRS**, which plays a vital role in healthcare delivery in low-resource settings, that’s non-negotiable.

## 🧾 My High-Level Asset Inventory for OpenMRS in the Cloud

As a security strategist and future GRC leader in healthcare, here’s how I approached our OpenMRS inventory today:

1. **☁️ Cloud Server (Ubuntu VM on AWS EC2)**  
   - Primary hosting environment for OpenMRS application  
   - Needs hardening, continuous patching, and access control  

2. **🗃️ OpenMRS MySQL Database**  
   - Stores all patient records, forms, and system configurations  
   - Critical confidentiality and integrity asset  

3. **📦 Backups on AWS S3 (Encrypted)**  
   - Full nightly snapshots of the OpenMRS DB and app  
   - Secured with IAM roles and object encryption  

4. **🧠 OpenMRS Core Application (v2.x with custom modules)**  
   - Includes APIs, modules, and UI components  
   - Requires version control, patch tracking, and code review  

5. **💻 Clinic Workstations (Web Browser Access to OpenMRS)**  
   - Doctor and nurse access points  
   - These endpoints can become the weakest link — require antivirus, MFA, browser hardening

## 💡 Why This Step Matters

Asset inventory isn’t just about documentation — it’s about **setting the stage for prioritization, control selection, monitoring, and compliance**.

If even one of these components is forgotten (e.g., a neglected backup on a contractor’s drive), it becomes a blind spot — and **you can’t defend a blind spot**.

In my leadership path toward GRC maturity, I’m adopting **CIS Control 1** as a non-negotiable baseline:  
> “Actively manage all hardware and software assets... so only authorized devices and software are given access.”

## 🧠 Reflection: Asset Confidence Check

The asset I feel least confident about?  
**Clinic endpoints.** Why? Because user behavior introduces unpredictable risk. From phishing to unpatched browsers, they require constant education, monitoring, and policy enforcement.  

🔍 **Actionable Next Step**:  
Create endpoint baseline configurations, enforce web access via VPN, and implement browser security policies organization-wide.

## Leadership Takeaway

Building GRC maturity starts here — **with visibility**.  
As I guide healthcare-focused organizations toward resilience, my approach is clear: **inventory first, then secure smartly.**

This exercise is not a checkbox. It’s a habit.
