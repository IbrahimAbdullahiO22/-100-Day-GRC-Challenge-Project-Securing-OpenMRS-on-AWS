# 📅 Day 6 – Overview of Key Frameworks: NIST RMF.  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## 🔍 Topic Overview:

Today we explored the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** – a gold-standard model originally designed for U.S. federal systems under **FISMA**, but widely adopted across industries, including healthcare.

The NIST RMF brings **structure, discipline, and lifecycle management** to risk, making it ideal for systems like **OpenMRS** that handle sensitive patient data.

> 📌 **Why it matters**: Without a structured framework, security often becomes reactive. RMF ensures a **step-by-step process** to proactively protect systems, classify data, and continually improve safeguards.

## 🧱 NIST RMF – The 7 Steps Simplified:

1. **Prepare** – Lay the foundation: define context, assign roles, and develop a risk strategy.
2. **Categorize** – Determine data sensitivity and the potential impact of compromise (e.g., ePHI in OpenMRS = high impact).
3. **Select** – Choose appropriate security controls (from NIST SP 800-53) based on categorization.
4. **Implement** – Apply the selected controls via system configurations, policies, and training.
5. **Assess** – ✅ **Test** the effectiveness of implemented controls — this is the step where we verify functionality and real-world readiness.
6. **Authorize** – A senior official reviews results and **formally accepts residual risk** before system operation.
7. **Monitor** – Continuously track control effectiveness, detect changes, and manage updates over time.

## 🏥 OpenMRS Use Case:

Imagine using RMF in a clinic running **OpenMRS**:

- **Prepare**: Clinic leadership defines roles (IT lead, compliance officer) and risk strategy.
- **Categorize**: Data includes **ePHI** – categorized as **High Sensitivity**.
- **Select**: Encryption, access control, audit logging, and MFA are chosen from NIST controls.
- **Implement**: IT team configures OpenMRS settings and trains staff.
- **Assess**: Security team (or third-party auditor) **tests if encryption, MFA, and logs are working**.
- **Authorize**: The director signs off based on assessment results.
- **Monitor**: Regular reviews, patching, and training updates keep security current.

## ✍️ Hands-On Exercise:

### ✅ Which RMF step involves testing controls?
**Answer:** Step 5 – **Assess**

> Testing controls is critical before authorization because it validates whether security safeguards like **encryption, firewalls, or access restrictions** are **working as intended**. For OpenMRS, this step could reveal misconfigurations or ineffective protections before real patient data is put at risk.

## 💡 Reflection:

Using RMF offers **clarity and accountability**. Without it, things fall through the cracks — roles aren’t clear, data isn’t properly classified, or risks are missed. A step-by-step framework ensures:

- **No major elements are skipped**
- **Risks are identified early**
- **Controls are verified before exposure**
- **Responsibility is distributed and traceable**

In the context of OpenMRS or any healthcare system, adopting RMF means **treating patient data with the diligence it deserves**. It’s not just bureaucracy — it’s about protecting lives.
