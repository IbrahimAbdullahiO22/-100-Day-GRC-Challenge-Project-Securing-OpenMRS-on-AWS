# 📅 Day 12 – Governance Document Hierarchy: Policies, Standards, and Procedures  
_100-Day GRC Cybersecurity Challenge by Ibrahim Abdullahi_

---

## 🔍 Topic Overview:

Today we explored how governance in cybersecurity and IT operations is built upon a structured **document hierarchy**:  
**Policy → Standard/Guideline → Procedure**  

Each level serves a unique purpose:
- **Policies**: High-level rules set by leadership to express intent and strategic direction.
- **Standards/Guidelines**: Specific technical or procedural requirements used to meet policy goals.
- **Procedures**: Detailed, step-by-step instructions to carry out the standards in daily operations.

> 🔑 Think of this like a roadmap:  
> **Policies tell you where you're going**,  
> **Standards show the route**,  
> **Procedures give you the GPS directions.**

## 🧱 Breakdown with OpenMRS Example:

### ✅ Policy
> “Only authorized personnel may access the OpenMRS system and patient records.”

- Sets the rule and intent from a governance level.
- Reflects HIPAA and privacy law alignment.
- Approved by executive leadership.

### ✅ Standard
> “All OpenMRS user accounts must use strong passwords and be secured with two-factor authentication (2FA).”

- A measurable, enforceable rule supporting the policy.
- Can be audited and tested for compliance.

### ✅ Procedure
> A written guide describing how IT staff configure 2FA for new OpenMRS user accounts:
1. Access the admin console  
2. Generate 2FA setup email  
3. Verify device-based token setup  
4. Confirm successful enrollment

- Clear operational direction for staff.

## ✍️ Hands-On Exercise: Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) – One-Liner

**My one-line AUP statement:**
> “Staff must use the OpenMRS system exclusively for patient care and maintain strict confidentiality of all patient information.”

This is a high-level policy that sets expectations for appropriate use, without going into procedural details.

---

## 💡 Reflection:

Writing that one-line AUP made me realize how important it is to **stay high-level** in a policy document — resist the urge to describe “how,” and focus on “what” and “why.”  
I now clearly see how **policies set the tone**, **standards ensure consistency**, and **procedures enable action**. If each level isn’t clearly defined, teams might misinterpret the rules or skip steps.

Having these layers helps align operations with **governance strategy** — making it easier to secure OpenMRS and ensure compliance across the organization.

> Clear governance documents prevent confusion, enable accountability, and support risk-informed decisions.
